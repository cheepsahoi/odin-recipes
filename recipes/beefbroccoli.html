    <p>
        One of the best things about beef broccoli is that it's a one pan 
        meal. This means, as the name might suggest, you only need the one
        pan to cook it! Indeed, all your ingredients in this dish come 
        together quite quickly. This tasty stir fry will take you half an
        hour to make, but the results are definitely worth it. Saucy, 
        savory, and scrumptious, the smell alone will make cooking this 
        dish worthwhile!

        Most of the time you dedicate to this recipe is spent on your 
        beef. In this beef broccoli recipe, we're using thin slices of
        beef sirloin. The goal is to get our meat so juicy and tender it
        practically melts in your mouth. And like all good things, this 
        takes time. You'll notice, then, that 25 minutes of this recipe
        — about 80% of the actual prep time — goes into ensuring your beef 
        is cooking low and slow. Low and slow is always key for cooking 
        any kind of meat, in order to ensure you get the tender texture 
        you desire.
