    <p>
        Beef Nilaga or Nilagang Baka is translated as "Boiled Beef". It's
        a simple dish that can be made by beginners as it's mostly just
        boiling the beef and adding your ingredients. It is best served
        when hot especially on cold and rainy days but it is still an
        enjoyable dish during a hot afternoon for its filling and delicious
        soup.
